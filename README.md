# SyntheSize-paper-supplementary-materials

This repository stores the data, results, and R scripts to generate these reuslts and figures for the corresponding paper *Optimizing Sample Size for Statistical Learning in Bulk Transcriptome Sequencing: A Learning Curve Approach*.

SyntheSize is a supervised learning framework designed for determining the optimal sample size by utilizing synthesized data across various sample sizes. This framework employs the inverse power law function (IPLF) to accurately fit augmented data corresponding to different sample sizes and their respective prediction accuracies. SyntheSize also illustrates the generated results through heatmap and UMAP(Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection).

The workflow of SyntheSize is depicted in the following figure:

## Usage

1. Download this repository.
2. Set your R working directory to the root directory of the project.
3. Run or knit any of the following R markdowns
    - `CaseStudy.Rmd` to train the classfiers and fit a learning curve for BRCA and RNABRCA data sets.
    - `DataOrganization.Rmd` to download TCGA data using TCGAbiolinks package, process the downloaded data into formatted counts and save them as .csv file.
    - `Evaluation.Rmd` to evaluate the samples generated by deep generative models using pilot data.
    - `Visualization.R` to generate all the figures in the paper.
